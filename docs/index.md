# Flatpak Developer Documentation

Flatpak's developer documentation covers everything you need to know to build and distribute applications. It includes an introduction to the basic concepts and a simple app building tutorial, before moving on to cover automated building and repository hosting.

Example tutorials are used throughout. To complete them, it is necessary to have flatpak and flatpak-builder installed on your system. [flatpak.org](http://flatpak.org/getting.html) has details on how to do this.
